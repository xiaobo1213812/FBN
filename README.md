Extension of the safety factor to the problem diagram is obtained using LLMs based on FBN logical reasoning

1.Feedback results from LLMs：Interact with LLMs to get the a priori probability assessment results of faulty nodes and the association strength assessment results between nodes

2.CPT：The conditional probability table of leaf nodes and intermediate nodes in the Bayesian network can be obtained from the mapping of fault tree logic gates, and the node association strengths are input into Algorithm 1 to obtain the conditional probability table of each node.
