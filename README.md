Extension of the safety factor to the problem diagram is obtained using LLMs based on FBN logical reasoning：

1.Feedback：Interact with LLMs to get the a priori probability assessment results of faulty nodes and the association strength assessment results between nodes

2.CPT：The conditional probability table of leaf nodes and intermediate nodes in the Bayesian network can be obtained from the mapping of fault tree logic gates, and the node association strengths are input into Algorithm 1 to obtain the conditional probability table of each node.

3.GeNIe: This paper uses the GeNIe software for logical reasoning, and this document illustrates the results of the GeNIe software's reasoning.

4.fuzzy_number: The fuzzy processed prior probability is a fuzzy possibility interval. To extract its eigenvalues, we defuzzify the fuzzy numbers using the area-mean method to obtain the specific likelihood value of event xi. Specific inference procedure for the fuzzy trigonometric function affiliation question is available at this document.
