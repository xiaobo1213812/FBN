# PF4SAFE: Problem Frames extension for Safety Analysis based on FBN Evaluation
## :blush:
## bbb

Extension of the safety factor to the problem diagram is obtained using LLMs based on FBN logical reasoning：

CPT：The conditional probability table of leaf nodes and intermediate nodes in the Bayesian network can be obtained from the mapping of fault tree logic gates, and the node association strengths are input into Niosy-OR model to obtain the CPT of each node.
